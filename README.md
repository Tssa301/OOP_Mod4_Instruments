OOP_Mod4_Instruments

In this hands-on activity:

All instruments can play a certain note. Percussion instruments play the note by touching a surface, string instruments play the note by vibrating a string in a resonance box, and wind instruments by blowing on the
instrument.

create a class structure that reflects the aforementioned situation, deciding whether some classes should be abstract or not (and whether there should be abstract methods).

All instruments must have a “play(String note)” method that accepts a given note (represented by a String). Each concrete instrument will delegate this operation to a method that represents its way of playing.
